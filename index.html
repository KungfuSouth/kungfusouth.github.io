              <p>Ever wanted to learn martial arts? Ever wished you could fight like Bruce Lee? Do you wish you could
                defend yourself or teach a bully a lesson in manners? Lol.</p>
              <p>When many of us think of martial arts we think of the late 20th century kungfu movies starring Bruce
                Lee, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme. More recently Chinese actors like Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat
                and Donnie Yen have taken up the mantle. These guys are great at what they do, aside from being good
                actors they have pretty neat fighting skills.
                <br><br>
                Many a little boy's dreams of learning kungfu began watching these legends of the silver screen enthrall
                us with their power and speed, flexibilty and grace. Aside from the physical component we were
                introduced to a mental side of martial arts which we probably dont understand but which was shown to as
                breathing, calmness and meditation. It seemed these masters all had this in common - a deep inner sense
                of power, calm and certainty, something which most of us have never experienced.
                <br><br> And while they
                are great martial artists and what they portray on screen is undoubtably martial arts techniques,
                fighting is only one aspect of martial arts.

              <h2 class="text-center">The truth about Martial Arts</h2>
              <p>In truth martial arts is more than simply a method of self-defence. It is a holistic philosophy of how
                to live a productive and successful life. Martial arts mastery strives to find a balance between the the
                mind, body and spirit, that is to achieve mental, emotional and physical control and well-being through
                regular practice.
                <br><br>
                The word Kungfu in its original meaning, can refer to any discipline or skill achieved through hard work
                and practice, not only fighting. Therefore any task in which one attains mastery is considered kungfu.
                Kungfu literally means the attainment of mastery.And whether or not practitioners have yet attained
                mastery they consistently practice said task.
                <br><br>
                This means that a master chef, a great athlete, a parent, a teacher, even a fireman can attain kungfu is
                his or her chosen profession or hobby.
                Its philosophy derives from the idea that success comes from constant and daily practice. Kungfu masters
                are those that
                have attained such a level of physical and mental mastery as to be said to have reached true
                enlightenment. If the purpose is to attain self-mastery, personal success and enlightenment then the
                instruction and methidology of martial arts in the East serves the same purpose as religion does in the
                West.

              <h2 class="text-center">Why Learn Martial Arts?</h2>
              <p><br><br>
                The benefits of learning martial arts are wide-ranging. Firstly lets look at the benefits of exercise.
                Aside from the obvious cardiovascular and respiritory health benefits attributed to regular exercise
                there are additional benefits to conditioning the body. Regular exercise improves bloodflow to the
                organs, limbs, joints heart and brain. This increased bloodflow carries with it increased levels of
                Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) which is vital to cell repair ad optimum bodily functions.
                <br><br>
                This increased Oxygen directly impacts the body's energy levels, muscular strength, cell repair and even
                muscle growth. Higher O<sub>2</sub> levels directly correlate to a healthier heart and lungs
                and lower risk of heart attacks and respiritory problems later in life. Therefore being active daily is
                one of the best ways to stay young, fit and healthy.
                <br><br>
                Martial arts is a great way to keep mobile and achieve this. This daily mobility not only strengthens
                muscles but also prevents muscle and joint injury. So may people develop knee, hip and back pain, not to
                mention arthritis. Strong muscles and regular stretching keeps joints healthy, flexible and pain free.
                <br><br>
                And then there are the mental and emotional gains. Learning martial arts takes time, practice and
                dedication. Building these mental attitudes as early in life as possible hardens to mind to dealing with
                the stresses of life. An important component of learning kungfu and indeed in learning any skill is to
                be able to meditae, calming the mind and emotions to allow to body to express its full potential.
                <br><br>
                Stress is a killer. Kungfu teaches how to effectively deal with internal and external stresses of life
                by learning
                how to focus and calm the mind. Developing mental and physical control is incredibly rewarding. It is
                great to see progress and feel pride in your success. Learning kungfu is a great way os pushing your
                boundaries and overcoming limitations. This mental strength will carry over int oall aspects of your
                life, work and relationships. You will feel more clarity and be more connected to your inner power.
                Enough said. So now that you are ready to start martial arts lets move
                on to choosing a fighting style.

              <h2 class="text-center">Fighting Styles - which Martial Arts style is Best?</h2>
              <p>There are many forms of martial arts. The best known styles are Kungfu, Wingchun, Juijitsu, Karate and
                Muai tai. These are styles of fighting and self-defense which have been developed over centuries in
                various parts of Asia. Kungfu, traditionally called Shaolin Kungfu as well as Wingchun come from
                Northern and Southern China respectfully, while Juijistu and Karate are Japanese and Muai Tai or
                Kickboxing as many know it derives from Thailand.<br><br>

                Each style of martial arts has its own philosophy, tradition and techniques specific to that style of
                fighting. For instance, in kickboxing and karate fighters prefer maintaining a longer distance from one
                another so that they can use their long legs for kicking with power. They need more space and time
                because although kicks can generate tremendous power, they can be slower than punches and ineffective at
                close quarters. So, in order kicks to be effective fighters need more room and time to generate a
                powerful kick.</p><br><br>

                data-src="img/woman-punching-the-hand-of-man-wearing-training-gloves-1544774.jpg"
                src="img/woman-punching-the-hand-of-man-wearing-training-gloves-blur.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Conversely, punching requires much less energy and can be thrown rapidly. This increase in speed means
                that punches are less powerful than kicks, but because the arms and shorter, faster and more flexible
                than the legs it also means that they are ideal for for close combat fighting.
                <br><br>
                Each style of fighting has clear benefits as well as drawbacks. In many cases it depends on personal
                preference or ability. Is wrestling better than kickboxing? Well, perhaps the wrestler is short, has
                short legs and a stocky build with a low center of gravity. This type of person might prefer close
                contact and grappling to kicking. He would want to get the kickboxer off his feet and on the ground to
                neutralize his kicking abilty.
                <br><br>
                So, which sould you choose. The majority of professional fighters have experience in many fighting
                styles. This gives them the advantage of insight into their opponents mindset and also opens up a world
                of possibilities. That said, choose whichever you prefer to start with. Jump right in and learn the
                ropes. Once you are practiced and have gained sufficient skill you will be ready try out other
                disciplines.

              <h2 class="text-center">Learn Self Defense Techniques</h2>
              <p>Anyone can learn the basics of kungfu, strengthen their bodies and learn how to defend themselves. Like
                any other skill all it takes is some dedication and practice. A good sensei will be able to teach highly
                effective self-defence tactics which may come in handy. Remember though that fighting in public shoud be
                a last resort and only when absolutely necessary.

                I used to be bullied every day until I learned how to stand up

                gained so much confidence too.
